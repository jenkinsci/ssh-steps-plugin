Jenkins pipeline steps which provides SSH facilities such as command execution or file transfer for continuous delivery. It internally uses the library of https://github.com/int128/groovy-ssh[Groovy SSH].

== Configuration
=== Remote

Most of the steps in this plugin require a common step variable called `remote`, which is Map of remote node settings such as user name, password and so on. Here is list of all possible keys that can be set.

== Pipeline Steps

The following pipeline steps are available with the initial version of this plugin.

=== sshCommand

This step executes given command on remote node and responds with output.

==== Input

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Description

|remote
|Remote, *Mandatory*, Refer to the Remote config for more details.
|Host config to run the command on.

|command
|String, *Mandatory*
|Shell command to run. Appending sudo is optional when `sudo` is `true`.

|sudo
|boolean, default: `false`.
|Interactively supplies the password, not required for password less sudo commands. +
 + 
 sshCommand with sudo:true param also requires pty:true on remote config with this upgrade. (This is only applicable for few platforms like Linux so apply this accordingly.) 

|failOnError
|boolean, default: `true`.
|If this is `false`, no job failure would occur though there is an error while running the command.

|dryRun
|boolean, default: `false`
|If this is true, no actual connection or operation is performed.
|===

==== Example

```groovy
node {
  def remote = [:]
  remote.name = 'test'
  remote.host = 'test.domain.com'
  remote.user = 'root'
  remote.password = 'password'
  remote.allowAnyHosts = true
  stage('Remote SSH') {
    sshCommand remote: remote, command: "ls -lrt"
    sshCommand remote: remote, command: "for i in {1..5}; do echo -n \"Loop \$i \"; date ; sleep 1; done"
  }
}
```

=== sshScript

This step executes given script(file) on remote node and responds with output.

==== Input

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Key
|Type
|Description

|remote
|Remote, *Mandatory*, Refer to the Remote config for more details.
|Host config to run the command on.

|script
|String, *Mandatory*
|Script file name from the workspace, current this doesn't support script with arguments. For that option you would need to copy over the file to remote node and run it as a command.

|failOnError
|boolean, default: `true`.
|If this is `false`, no job failure would occur though there is an error while running the command.

|dryRun
|boolean, default: `false`
|If this is true, no actual connection or operation is performed.
|===

==== Example

```groovy
node {
  def remote = [:]
  remote.name = 'test'
  remote.host = 'test.domain.com'
  remote.user = 'root'
  remote.password = 'password'
  remote.allowAnyHosts = true

remote.allowAnyHosts = true

node {
    withCredentials([sshUserPrivateKey(credentialsId: 'sshUser', keyFileVariable: 'identity', passphraseVariable: '', usernameVariable: 'userName')]) {
        remote.user = userName
        remote.identityFile = identity
        stage("SSH Steps Rocks!") {
            writeFile file: 'abc.sh', text: 'ls'
